# 📊 Car Price Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the selling price of used cars based on key features such as brand, year, mileage, engine volume, fuel type, and body type.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

- Predict car prices using a clean and interpretable regression model  
- Apply end-to-end data science workflow from data cleaning to evaluation  
- Visualize relationships between features and price  

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization  
- Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation  

---

## 🧹 Preprocessing Steps

- Removal of missing and irrelevant values  
- Detection and elimination of outliers (e.g., extreme prices or engine sizes)  
- Label encoding of categorical features (Brand, Fuel Type, etc.)  
- Logarithmic transformation of the target variable (Price)  
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler  

---

## 🧪 Model

A **Linear Regression** model was trained and evaluated using:

- R² Score  
- Residual analysis  

---

## 📈 Results

- The model performs well on unseen data and provides a solid baseline for future improvements  
- Strong feature interpretability and clean prediction pipeline
